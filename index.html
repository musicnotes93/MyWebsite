    <p class="single-review"> Mallory played at my church for our annual Thankoffering service. 
    The music she selected was calming, beautiful and added so much to our service. 
    My congregation was very impressed with her music and ability! It was our honor to 
    have her at our service and I highly recommend using her if you need a highly qualified 
    violinist! She arrived on time, was always available via email and had such a pleasant 
    attitude...I would give her 6 star rating if I could!! You will be glad if you hire her!!</p>
    <p class="single-review">Perfect compliment to a Graylyn wedding in Winston Salem! 
        Wonderful to work with and a virtuoso performance. Asked for and included a lovely 
        cellist. Highly recommended.</p>
    <p class="single-review">Mallory was amazing to work with, a great communicator and most of 
        all a great artist. She played everything perfectly!! Recommend 100%.</p>
    <p class="single-review">Mallory was prompt, professional, flexible, and incredible. 
        She gave the ceremony exactly the right finishing touch and even played some off-beat 
        requests of ours.</p>
    <p class="single-review">Mallory did an outstanding job playing for my daughter and 
        son-in-law's wedding! She arrived early and played exactly what we had asked her to. 
        She began with some music on her guitar as guests arrived, then played her violin when 
        the ceremony began. She was helpful in giving the bride a list of suggested repertoire 
        to play. Extremely professional and courteous. Thank you, Mallory!</p>
